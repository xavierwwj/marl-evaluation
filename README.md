# A Comparison of the Performance of Various Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) Algorithms on a Customised Gym Environment

Here we will evaluate the performance of multi-agent algorithms that we have discussed, namely the MADDPG and QMIX algorithms, using RLLib's library and Gym for the custom environment.
